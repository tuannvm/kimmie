				The Macintosh (/ˈmækɪntɒʃ/ MAK-in-tosh; branded simply as Mac since 1998) is a family of personal computers
				designed,
				manufactured and sold by Apple Inc. since January 1984.

			<h2>History</h2>
			<p>
				The original 15-inch MacBook Pro was announced on January 10, 2006, by Steve Jobs at the Macworld Conference &
				Expo.[2]
				The 17-inch model was unveiled on April 24, 2006.[3] The first design was largely a carryover from the PowerBook
				G4, but
				uses Intel Core CPUs instead of PowerPC G4 chips.[4] The 15-inch MacBook Pro weighs the same as the 15-inch
				aluminum
				PowerBook G4, but is 0.1 inches (0.25 cm) deeper, 0.4 inches (1.0 cm) wider, and 0.1 inches (0.25 cm)
				thinner.[5] Other
				changes from the PowerBook include a built-in iSight webcam and the inclusion of MagSafe, a magnetic power
				connector
				designed to detach easily when yanked. These features were later brought over to the MacBook. The optical drive
				was
				reduced in size in order to fit into the slimmer MacBook Pro, hence it runs slower than the optical drive in the
				PowerBook G4 and cannot write to dual layer DVDs.[4][6]

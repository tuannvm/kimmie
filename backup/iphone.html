				The iPhone is a line of smartphones designed and marketed by Apple Inc. All generations of the iPhone use
				Apple's iOS
				mobile operating system software. The first-generation iPhone was released on June 29, 2007, and multiple new
				hardware
				iterations with new iOS releases have been released since.

			<h2>History</h2>
			<p>
				At the Macworld Conference & Expo in January 2007, Steve Jobs introduced the long-anticipated[247] iPhone, a
				convergence
				of an Internet-enabled smartphone and iPod.[248] The first-generation iPhone was released on June 29, 2007, for
				$499 (4
				GB) and $599 (8 GB) with an AT&T contract.[249] On February 5, 2008, it was updated to have 16 GB of memory, in
				addition
				to the 8 GB and 4 GB models.[250] It combined a 2.5G quad band GSM and EDGE cellular phone with features found
				in
				handheld devices, running a scaled-down version of OS X (dubbed iPhone OS after the launch and later renamed to
				iOS),
				with various Mac OS X applications such as Safari and Mail. It also includes web-based and Dashboard apps such
				as Google
				Maps and Weather. The iPhone features a 3.5-inch (89 mm) touchscreen display, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi (both "b" and
				"g").[248]

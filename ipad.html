			<h2>History</h2>
			<p>
				On January 27, 2010, Apple introduced their much-anticipated media tablet, the iPad.[282][283] It offers
				multi-touch
				interaction with multimedia formats including newspapers, e-books, photos, videos, music, word processing
				documents,
				video games, and most existing iPhone apps using a 9.7-inch screen.[284] It also includes a mobile version of
				Safari for
				web browsing, as well as access to the App Store, iTunes Library, iBookstore, Contacts, and Notes. Content is
				downloadable via Wi-Fi and optional 3G service or synced through the user's computer.[285] AT&T was initially
				the sole
				U.S. provider of 3G wireless access for the iPad.[286]
